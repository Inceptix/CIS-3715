Then, you will need to decide what to do with the categorical attributes. The easiest is to simply ignore them, but it would reduce your accuracy. A better way (you have to try it) is to convert the categorical attributes to numbers. It is up to you to decide what distance measure to use, how to pick `k`, and make any other decision that will help you increase the accuracy. For example, it might help you to scale the attributes to the same range. Remember that any transformation you do on the training data needs to be repeated on the test data. Report on the best accuracy you are able to get (please do not forget to split the data into training and test before proceeding). Also report the confusion matrix.
